# 3D_Human_Modelling_Blender_Animation

This Computer graphics project is made using blender with 3D modelling techniques to make a human and its animation for sign language.I Created a webpage to show the animation with the Indian Sign Language videos.

# Problem statement

Dumb and deaf people use sign language to interact, hence normal people face problem in identifying their language by signs made. As a result, there is a requirement to identifiy various indications and communicates the information to ordinary people.

# Human Model

This model was created by me using this video as a reference https://youtu.be/WlaMfIgS2ns

# Project Roadmap

1. Understand the problem statement
2. Creating Human model using blender
3. Animating the Human model for several signs
4. Compiling the videos of the animations
5. Creating a webpage

# Webpage

Here is the webpage which i made using the compiled videos
